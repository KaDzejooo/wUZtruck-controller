# STM32H735G-DK Universal RC Controller (STURCC)

## About üööüïπÔ∏è
This controller is configured for 272 x 480 pixels 24bpp screen resolution.
Used to control RC vehicles, it is using Touch GFX app provided by
ST Microelectronics to streamline development process.
Controller can be used to controll any remote device including
any RC vechicle.


## Features 
- 5 analog channels (2 joystick and trigger)
- 480 x 272 screen
- colorfull and usefull menu
- Real time operating system (FREE-RTOS) allowing for perfect 60fps GUI 
- camera live feed on screen (if rc model has one)
- by default configured for wUZtruck SC truck models
- full context switching support (just a few lines of code to add functionality of your model)
- GB and PL languabe by default
- configured to work with any UART transceiver
- ensures communication correctness by using bidirectional communication and integrity manager task 

## Building the controller
To succesfully create your own ST Uniwersal RC Controller:
- 3D print all pieces and solder all the connections (Part files and build instructions)
- Flash STM32 with firmware (Instruction)
- Enjoy <3
